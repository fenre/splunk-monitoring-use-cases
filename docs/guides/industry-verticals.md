## Quick Start — Industry-Specific Onboarding

Pick your vertical and start with the highest-value UC:

| Vertical | First UC |
|----------|---------|
| **Energy** | UC-21.1.1 (SCADA Alarm Rate / Flooding) |
| **Manufacturing** | UC-21.2.1 (OEE Trending) |
| **Healthcare** | UC-21.3.1 (HL7 Message Health) |
| **Transportation** | UC-21.4.1 (Fleet Telematics) |
| **Oil & Gas** | UC-21.5.1 (Wellhead SCADA) |
| **Retail** | UC-21.6.1 (POS Transaction Health) |
| **Aviation** | UC-21.7.1 (BHS Throughput) |
| **Telco** | UC-21.8.1 (5G Core SBI Health) |
| **Water** | UC-21.9.1 (Treatment SCADA) |
| **Insurance** | UC-21.10.1 (Claims Cycle Time) |

## Overview

### Why industry-vertical integration matters

Industry verticals share a pattern:
- **Heavy regulatory environment** (HIPAA, NERC CIP, PCI-DSS, FDA, TSA, etc.)
- **Industry-specific protocols** (HL7, FHIR, ISA-95, NETCONF, CDR, Modbus, OPC)
- **Business KPIs alongside IT KPIs** (OEE, MTTR, claim cycle time, RPO/RTO)
- **Cross-domain correlation** (SCADA → safety → financial impact)
- **Specialized terminology** that must be respected

### What good looks like

| Dimension | Without integration | With full integration |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Industry KPIs | Per-system reports | Unified Splunk dashboards |
| Regulatory evidence | Annual scramble | Continuous attestation |
| Safety event correlation | Manual review | Automated cross-system |
| Business process visibility | Silos | End-to-end via Splunk |

## Cross-Product Correlation

### Manufacturing — OEE drop → Maintenance prediction

```spl
(index=mfg sourcetype="oee:metric" earliest=-1h)
| stats avg(oee) as oee by line_id
| where oee < 75
| join line_id [search index=mfg sourcetype="opcua:metrics" metric_name IN ("vibration_mm_s","temperature_c") | stats avg(metric_value) as avg_val by line_id, metric_name]
```

### Healthcare — HL7 latency → Patient impact

```spl
(index=healthcare sourcetype="hl7:adt" earliest=-1h)
| stats latency_ms by patient_mrn
| where latency_ms > 5000
```

### Retail — Failed POS → Lost revenue

```spl
(index=retail sourcetype="retail:pos" status="failure" earliest=-1h)
| stats sum(transaction_amount) as lost_revenue by store_id
| sort -lost_revenue
```

<a id="compliance"></a>
## Compliance Mapping by Vertical

| Vertical | Key regulations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Energy** | NERC CIP, FERC, ISO/RTO directives, EU NIS2<sup class="ref">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</sup> |
| **Manufacturing** | ISA-95, IEC 62443<sup class="ref">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</sup>, ITAR (defense), ISO 9001 |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA, HITECH, FDA 21 CFR Part 11 + 820, GxP, 42 CFR Part 2 |
| **Transportation** | DOT, FMCSA HOS, IATA |
| **Oil & Gas** | TSA Pipeline, API RP 1164, BSEE |
| **Retail** | PCI-DSS, GDPR/CCPA, FTC Safeguards |
| **Aviation** | FAA, EASA, ICAO, TSA |
| **Telco** | FCC, CALEA, GDPR, EU EECC |
| **Water** | EPA SDWA, AWIA, EU drinking water directive |
| **Insurance** | Solvency II, NAIC, SOX, GDPR |

---

<a id="sizing"></a>
## Capacity Planning and Sizing

| Vertical | Daily volume (large org) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Energy | 10-100 GB |
| Manufacturing | 5-50 GB per plant |
| Healthcare | 10-200 GB per hospital system |
| Logistics | 5-100 GB |
| Oil & Gas | 50-500 GB |
| Retail | 10-100 GB per chain |
| Aviation | 50-500 GB per major hub |
| Telco | 1+ TB (CDR alone) |
| Water | 1-10 GB per utility |
| Insurance | 5-50 GB |

---

<a id="dashboards"></a>
## Recommended Dashboard Layouts (per Vertical)

Each vertical should have:
- Crawl: First-30-day onboarding dashboard
- Walk: Operational dashboards
- Run: Executive scorecards + compliance attestation

---

<a id="itsi"></a>
## ITSI Service Modeling

Per-vertical service trees, e.g., Manufacturing:
```
Manufacturing Posture
├── Per-Plant
│   ├── Production lines
│   ├── OEE per line
│   ├── Equipment health
│   └── Quality KPIs
├── Per-Process
└── Compliance posture
```

---

<a id="soar"></a>
## SOAR Playbook Examples

### Healthcare: Suspected diversion → Lock + Investigate

```
1. RECEIVE notable: pharmacy diversion candidate
2. SUSPEND user dispensing access (pharmacy system API)
3. CREATE compliance investigation ticket
4. NOTIFY pharmacy director
```

### Retail: POS down → Auto-failover

```
1. RECEIVE notable: POS terminal down 5min
2. CALL POS vendor API: failover to backup
3. NOTIFY store manager
4. CREATE Sev-2 ticket
```

### Telco: 5G UPF degraded → Auto-traffic-shift

```
1. RECEIVE notable: UPF latency > 50ms
2. CALL SMF API: shift traffic to redundant UPF
3. NOTIFY core engineering
```

---

<a id="multi-region"></a>
## Multi-Region Strategy

- Per-region indexes (`telco_us`, `telco_eu`, `telco_apac`)
- Data sovereignty: keep PHI / PII in-region
- Federated dashboards across regions

---

<a id="security-hardening"></a>
## Security Hardening

- Industry-specific RBAC (e.g., separate PHI access role for healthcare)
- Encryption at rest for all PHI/PII/PCI indexes
- Audit log retention per regulation (3-7 years typical)
- Field-level RBAC for sensitive identifiers

---

<a id="roadmap"></a>
## Crawl / Walk / Run Roadmap

### Crawl (Month 1)

1. Onboard 1-2 industry-specific data sources
2. Per-vertical compliance index strategy
3. Crawl-tier KPI dashboard

### Walk (Month 2-3)

1. Onboard remaining systems
2. ITSI service modeling
3. Per-vertical SOAR playbooks
4. Cross-system correlation

### Run (Month 4+)

1. Executive vertical scorecards
2. ML anomaly detection per vertical
3. Quarterly regulatory attestation
4. Predictive analytics

---

<a id="validation-checklist"></a>
## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Day 1: First vertical-specific event in Splunk
- [ ] Day 30: Walk-tier UCs deployed for chosen vertical
- [ ] Day 90: Executive dashboards live; compliance attestation operational

---

<a id="known-limitations"></a>
## Known Limitations and Gaps

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Industry protocols (HL7v2, NETCONF)** | Custom parsing | Use Splunk OT add-on or vendor parsers |
| **High-volume CDR (telco)** | Storage cost | Summary indexing + selective retention |
| **PHI / PII compliance** | Field-level controls | RBAC + masking |
| **Vertical TA availability** | Often custom | Build per-vendor connector |

---

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## Troubleshooting

### HL7 messages not parsing

- Verify HL7 parser configured (vendor-specific)
- Check MSH segment delimiters

### Telco CDR ingest lag

- Check HEC token rate limits
- Use multi-HEC for parallel ingest

### POS data inconsistent across stores

- Verify store time zone handling
- Check CLOCK skew

---

<a id="faq"></a>
## FAQ

**Q: Should I use one Splunk for multiple verticals?**
A: Yes — single platform, per-vertical indexes / RBAC / dashboards.

**Q: How to handle PHI in Splunk?**
A: Encryption at rest + field-level RBAC + audit access to PHI indexes.

**Q: ITSI vs custom dashboards for verticals?**
A: ITSI is best for service-health KPIs; custom dashboards for non-service specifics.

**Q: How long to retain CDR / telco data?**
A: 3 years minimum (CALEA in US, varies elsewhere).

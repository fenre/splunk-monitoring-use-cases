# UC-1.1.5 · System Load Anomalies

## Description

Load average exceeding CPU core count indicates process queuing. Useful as an early warning for runaway processes or unexpected workloads.

## Value

Load average exceeding CPU core count indicates process queuing. Useful as an early warning for runaway processes or unexpected workloads.

## Implementation

The `vmstat` sourcetype provides `loadAvg1mi` (1-minute load average). For CPU core count, use either the `hardware` sourcetype (`CPU_COUNT` field) or a server inventory lookup. Alternatively, create a custom `uptime` scripted input parsing all three load averages. Alert when load ratio exceeds 1.5 for 15+ minutes.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=vmstat` (includes `loadAvg1mi`) or custom `uptime` scripted input.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
The `vmstat` sourcetype provides `loadAvg1mi` (1-minute load average). For CPU core count, use either the `hardware` sourcetype (`CPU_COUNT` field) or a server inventory lookup. Alternatively, create a custom `uptime` scripted input parsing all three load averages. Alert when load ratio exceeds 1.5 for 15+ minutes.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=vmstat host=*
| stats latest(loadAvg1mi) as load1 by host
| lookup server_inventory host OUTPUT cpu_count
| eval load_ratio = round(load1 / cpu_count, 2)
| where load_ratio > 1.5
| sort -load_ratio
| table host load1 cpu_count load_ratio
```

Understanding this SPL

**System Load Anomalies** — Load average exceeding CPU core count indicates process queuing. Useful as an early warning for runaway processes or unexpected workloads.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=vmstat` (includes `loadAvg1mi`) or custom `uptime` scripted input. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: vmstat. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=vmstat. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions.
• Enriches events using `lookup` (lookup definition + optional OUTPUT fields).
• `eval` defines or adjusts **load_ratio** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Filters the current rows with `where load_ratio > 1.5` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.
• Pipeline stage (see **System Load Anomalies**): table host load1 cpu_count load_ratio

Step 3 — Validate
On the host, compare with `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, or `sar` as appropriate to this use case. For log-only detections, compare with the relevant file under `/var/log` (or `journalctl`) on a test host. Confirm that indexed event counts and field values line up with what you see on the system and that your role can search the right indexes and fields.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (load1/5/15 over time), Table of high-load hosts with core count context.

Scripted input (generic example)
This use case relies on a scripted input. In the app's local/inputs.conf add a stanza such as:

```ini
[script://$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/YourApp/bin/collect.sh]
interval = 300
sourcetype = your_sourcetype
index = main
disabled = 0
```

The script should print one event per line (e.g. key=value). Example minimal script (bash):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output metrics or events, one per line
echo "metric=value timestamp=$(date +%s)"
```

For full details (paths, scheduling, permissions), see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

## SPL

```spl
index=os sourcetype=vmstat host=*
| stats latest(loadAvg1mi) as load1 by host
| lookup server_inventory host OUTPUT cpu_count
| eval load_ratio = round(load1 / cpu_count, 2)
| where load_ratio > 1.5
| sort -load_ratio
| table host load1 cpu_count load_ratio
```

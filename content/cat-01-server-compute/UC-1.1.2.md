# UC-1.1.2 · Memory Pressure Detection (Linux)

## Description

Prevents OOM kills, application crashes, and unresponsive systems by detecting memory exhaustion early.

## Value

Prevents OOM kills, application crashes, and unresponsive systems by detecting memory exhaustion early.

## Implementation

Enable `vmstat` scripted input in Splunk_TA_nix (interval=60). Key fields: `memTotalMB`, `memFreeMB`, `memUsedMB`, `memUsedPct` (memory), `swapUsedPct` (swap percentage), `loadAvg1mi` (1-min load avg). Set alert when swapUsedPct exceeds 20% or memUsedPct exceeds 95% sustained for 10 minutes.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=vmstat`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Enable `vmstat` scripted input in Splunk_TA_nix (interval=60). Key fields: `memTotalMB`, `memFreeMB`, `memUsedMB`, `memUsedPct` (memory), `swapUsedPct` (swap percentage), `loadAvg1mi` (1-min load avg). Set alert when swapUsedPct exceeds 20% or memUsedPct exceeds 95% sustained for 10 minutes.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=vmstat host=*
| timechart span=5m avg(memUsedPct) as memory_pct, avg(swapUsedPct) as swap_pct by host
```

Understanding this SPL

**Memory Pressure Detection (Linux)** — Prevents OOM kills, application crashes, and unresponsive systems by detecting memory exhaustion early.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=vmstat`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: vmstat. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=vmstat. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `timechart` plots the metric over time using **span=5m** buckets with a separate series **by host** — ideal for trending and alerting on this use case.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.mem_used_percent) as mem_pct
                        avg(Performance.swap_used_percent) as swap_pct
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Memory
  by Performance.host span=5m
| where mem_pct > 95 OR swap_pct > 20
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**Memory Pressure Detection (Linux)** — Prevents OOM kills, application crashes, and unresponsive systems by detecting memory exhaustion early.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=vmstat`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

This **CIM or accelerated** block uses normalized field names and/or `tstats` over data models. Enable **acceleration** on the referenced models (and correct CIM knowledge objects) or the search may return nothing.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` against accelerated summaries for data model `Performance` — enable acceleration for that model.
• Filters the current rows with `where mem_pct > 95 OR swap_pct > 20` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Area chart (memory + swap stacked), Single value panels showing current utilization, Gauge widget for threshold display.

Scripted input (generic example)
This use case relies on a scripted input. In the app's local/inputs.conf add a stanza such as:

```ini
[script://$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/YourApp/bin/collect.sh]
interval = 300
sourcetype = your_sourcetype
index = main
disabled = 0
```

The script should print one event per line (e.g. key=value). Example minimal script (bash):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output metrics or events, one per line
echo "metric=value timestamp=$(date +%s)"
```

For full details (paths, scheduling, permissions), see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

## SPL

```spl
index=os sourcetype=vmstat host=*
| timechart span=5m avg(memUsedPct) as memory_pct, avg(swapUsedPct) as swap_pct by host
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.mem_used_percent) as mem_pct
                        avg(Performance.swap_used_percent) as swap_pct
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Memory
  by Performance.host span=5m
| where mem_pct > 95 OR swap_pct > 20
```

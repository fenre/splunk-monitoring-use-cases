# UC-1.1.6 · Process Crash Detection (Linux)

## Description

Immediate awareness of unexpected process terminations. Critical for services that don't auto-restart or have no watchdog.

## Value

Immediate awareness of unexpected process terminations. Critical for services that don't auto-restart or have no watchdog.

## Implementation

Forward `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/syslog` via UF inputs.conf. Create an alert on keywords: `segfault`, `killed process`, `core dumped`. Enrich with service/owner lookup.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`, Splunk Add-on for Syslog.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Forward `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/syslog` via UF inputs.conf. Create an alert on keywords: `segfault`, `killed process`, `core dumped`. Enrich with service/owner lookup.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=syslog ("segfault" OR "killed process" OR "core dumped" OR "terminated" OR "SIGABRT" OR "SIGSEGV")
| rex "(?<process_name>\w+)\[\d+\]"
| stats count by host, process_name, _time
| sort -count
```

Understanding this SPL

**Process Crash Detection (Linux)** — Immediate awareness of unexpected process terminations. Critical for services that don't auto-restart or have no watchdog.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`, Splunk Add-on for Syslog. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: syslog. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=syslog. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• Extracts fields with `rex` (regular expression).
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host, process_name, _time** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.

Step 3 — Validate
On the host, compare with `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, or `sar` as appropriate to this use case. For log-only detections, compare with the relevant file under `/var/log` (or `journalctl`) on a test host. Confirm that indexed event counts and field values line up with what you see on the system and that your role can search the right indexes and fields.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Events list (timeline view), Stats table grouped by host and process, Bar chart of crash counts by process.

## SPL

```spl
index=os sourcetype=syslog ("segfault" OR "killed process" OR "core dumped" OR "terminated" OR "SIGABRT" OR "SIGSEGV")
| rex "(?<process_name>\w+)\[\d+\]"
| stats count by host, process_name, _time
| sort -count
```

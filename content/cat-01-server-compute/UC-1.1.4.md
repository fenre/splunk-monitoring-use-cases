# UC-1.1.4 · Disk I/O Saturation (Linux)

## Description

High I/O wait degrades application performance even when CPU and memory look healthy. Catches storage bottlenecks before users complain.

## Value

Slow disks show up as long waits even when CPU and memory charts look fine; we flag that pattern so storage or array issues get attention before apps time out.

## Implementation

Enable `iostat` scripted input (interval=60). Key fields: `avgWaitMillis` (await — avg wait in ms), `avgSvcMillis` (svctm — avg service time in ms), `bandwUtilPct` (disk utilization %), `rReq_PS`/`wReq_PS` (read/write IOPS). Alert when avgWaitMillis >20ms sustained over 10 minutes. Correlate with application latency metrics for root cause.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=iostat`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Enable `iostat` scripted input (interval=60). Key fields: `avgWaitMillis` (await — avg wait in ms), `avgSvcMillis` (svctm — avg service time in ms), `bandwUtilPct` (disk utilization %), `rReq_PS`/`wReq_PS` (read/write IOPS). Alert when avgWaitMillis >20ms sustained over 10 minutes. Correlate with application latency metrics for root cause.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=iostat host=*
| timechart span=5m avg(avgWaitMillis) as avg_wait, avg(avgSvcMillis) as avg_svc by host
| where avg_wait > 20
```

Understanding this SPL

**Disk I/O Saturation (Linux)** — High I/O wait degrades application performance even when CPU and memory look healthy. Catches storage bottlenecks before users complain.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=iostat`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: iostat. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=iostat. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `timechart` plots the metric over time using **span=5m** buckets with a separate series **by host** — ideal for trending and alerting on this use case.
• Filters the current rows with `where avg_wait > 20` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.read_latency) as read_ms avg(Performance.write_latency) as write_ms
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Storage
  by Performance.host span=5m
| eval worst_ms=max(read_ms, write_ms)
| where worst_ms > 20
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**Disk I/O Saturation (Linux)** — High I/O wait degrades application performance even when CPU and memory look healthy. Catches storage bottlenecks before users complain.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=iostat`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

This **CIM or accelerated** block uses normalized field names and/or `tstats` over data models. Enable **acceleration** on the referenced models (and correct CIM knowledge objects) or the search may return nothing.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` against accelerated summaries for data model `Performance` — enable acceleration for that model.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **worst_ms** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Filters the current rows with `where worst_ms > 20` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
On the host, compare with `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, or `sar` as appropriate to this use case. For log-only detections, compare with the relevant file under `/var/log` (or `journalctl`) on a test host. Confirm that indexed event counts and field values line up with what you see on the system and that your role can search the right indexes and fields.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (latency over time by host), Heatmap of I/O wait across hosts.

Scripted input (generic example)
This use case relies on a scripted input. In the app's local/inputs.conf add a stanza such as:

```ini
[script://$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/YourApp/bin/collect.sh]
interval = 300
sourcetype = your_sourcetype
index = main
disabled = 0
```

The script should print one event per line (e.g. key=value). Example minimal script (bash):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output metrics or events, one per line
echo "metric=value timestamp=$(date +%s)"
```

## SPL

```spl
index=os sourcetype=iostat host=*
| timechart span=5m avg(avgWaitMillis) as avg_wait, avg(avgSvcMillis) as avg_svc by host
| where avg_wait > 20
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.read_latency) as read_ms avg(Performance.write_latency) as write_ms
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Storage
  by Performance.host span=5m
| eval worst_ms=max(read_ms, write_ms)
| where worst_ms > 20
```

# UC-1.1.29 · Context Switch Rate Anomaly Detection (Linux)

## Description

Excessive context switching reduces CPU cache effectiveness and indicates scheduler overload or contention.

## Value

Excessive context switching reduces CPU cache effectiveness and indicates scheduler overload or contention.

## Implementation

Monitor vmstat context switch counter (cs field). Use baseline and anomaly detection to alert on sustained context switch rates that exceed 2 standard deviations above normal, indicating scheduler pressure.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=vmstat`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Monitor vmstat context switch counter (cs field). Use baseline and anomaly detection to alert on sustained context switch rates that exceed 2 standard deviations above normal, indicating scheduler pressure.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=vmstat host=*
| bin _time span=5m
| stats avg(cs) as avg_ctx_switch by host, _time
| streamstats window=100 avg(avg_ctx_switch) as baseline stdev(avg_ctx_switch) as stddev by host
| eval upper_bound=baseline+(2*stddev)
| where avg_ctx_switch > upper_bound
```

Understanding this SPL

**Context Switch Rate Anomaly Detection (Linux)** — Excessive context switching reduces CPU cache effectiveness and indicates scheduler overload or contention.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=vmstat`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: vmstat. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=vmstat. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• Discretizes time or numeric ranges with `bin`/`bucket`.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host, _time** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions.
• `streamstats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **upper_bound** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Filters the current rows with `where avg_ctx_switch > upper_bound` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Step 3 — Validate
On the host, compare with `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, or `sar` as appropriate to this use case. For log-only detections, compare with the relevant file under `/var/log` (or `journalctl`) on a test host. Confirm that indexed event counts and field values line up with what you see on the system and that your role can search the right indexes and fields.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Timechart, Anomaly Detector

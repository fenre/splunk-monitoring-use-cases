# UC-1.1.72 · SSH Public Key Changes

## Description

SSH key modifications enable persistent unauthorized access, indicating potential account compromise.

## Value

SSH key modifications enable persistent unauthorized access, indicating potential account compromise.

## Implementation

Monitor ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files for all users via auditctl. Create alerts on any modifications. Include user and source process information to determine if change was authorized.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix, custom scripted input`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=linux_audit`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Monitor ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files for all users via auditctl. Create alerts on any modifications. Include user and source process information to determine if change was authorized.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=linux_audit path~="\.ssh/authorized_keys" action=modified
| stats count by host, auid, user
| where count > 0
```

Understanding this SPL

**SSH Public Key Changes** — SSH key modifications enable persistent unauthorized access, indicating potential account compromise.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=linux_audit`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix, custom scripted input`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: linux_audit. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=linux_audit. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host, auid, user** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• Filters the current rows with `where count > 0` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count
  from datamodel=Authentication.Authentication
  where Authentication.action=failure
  by Authentication.user Authentication.src Authentication.dest span=1h
| where count > 5
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**SSH Public Key Changes** — SSH key modifications enable persistent unauthorized access, indicating potential account compromise.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=linux_audit`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix, custom scripted input`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

This **CIM or accelerated** block uses normalized field names and/or `tstats` over data models. Enable **acceleration** on the referenced models (and correct CIM knowledge objects) or the search may return nothing.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` against accelerated summaries for data model `Authentication.Authentication` — enable acceleration for that model.
• Filters the current rows with `where count > 5` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Alert, Table

## SPL

```spl

## CIM SPL

| tstats `summariesonly` count
  from datamodel=Authentication.Authentication
  where Authentication.action=failure
  by Authentication.user Authentication.src Authentication.dest span=1h
| where count > 5

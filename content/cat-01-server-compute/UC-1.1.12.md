# UC-1.1.12 · NTP Time Sync Drift (Linux)

## Description

Clock drift causes authentication failures (Kerberos), log correlation issues, transaction ordering problems, and certificate validation failures.

## Value

Clock drift causes authentication failures (Kerberos), log correlation issues, transaction ordering problems, and certificate validation failures.

## Implementation

Enable the `ntp` scripted input in Splunk_TA_nix (interval=300). It runs `ntpq -pn` and outputs peer data. The `offset` field is in milliseconds. Alert when offset exceeds 100ms or stratum exceeds 5.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_nix`.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=ntp` (scripted input via `ntpq -p` or `chronyc tracking`).
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Enable the `ntp` scripted input in Splunk_TA_nix (interval=300). It runs `ntpq -pn` and outputs peer data. The `offset` field is in milliseconds. Alert when offset exceeds 100ms or stratum exceeds 5.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=os sourcetype=ntp host=*
| eval offset_ms = abs(offset)
| stats latest(offset_ms) as drift_ms, latest(stratum) as stratum by host
| where drift_ms > 100 OR stratum > 5
| sort -drift_ms
```

Understanding this SPL

**NTP Time Sync Drift (Linux)** — Clock drift causes authentication failures (Kerberos), log correlation issues, transaction ordering problems, and certificate validation failures.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=ntp` (scripted input via `ntpq -p` or `chronyc tracking`). **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_nix`. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: os; **sourcetype**: ntp. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=os, sourcetype=ntp. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **offset_ms** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by host** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• Filters the current rows with `where drift_ms > 100 OR stratum > 5` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (drift over time by host), Table of hosts with excessive drift.

Scripted input (generic example)
This use case relies on a scripted input. In the app's local/inputs.conf add a stanza such as:

```ini
[script://$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/YourApp/bin/collect.sh]
interval = 300
sourcetype = your_sourcetype
index = main
disabled = 0
```

The script should print one event per line (e.g. key=value). Example minimal script (bash):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output metrics or events, one per line
echo "metric=value timestamp=$(date +%s)"
```

For full details (paths, scheduling, permissions), see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

| stats latest(offset_ms) as drift_ms, latest(stratum) as stratum by host
| where drift_ms > 100 OR stratum > 5
| sort -drift_ms
```

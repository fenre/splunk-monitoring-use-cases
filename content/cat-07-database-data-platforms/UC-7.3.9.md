*Normalized RU/s consumption vs provisioned throughput identifies hot partitions and autoscale effectiveness We use it to stay ahead of pain for applications and the people who depend on the data.*

## Description

Normalized RU/s consumption vs provisioned throughput identifies hot partitions and autoscale effectiveness.

## Value

Normalized RU/s consumption vs provisioned throughput identifies hot partitions and autoscale effectiveness.

## Implementation

Map exact metric names from your Azure diagnostic settings. Alert when normalized consumption >90% sustained. Split by partition key if available in custom dimensions.

## Detailed Implementation

### Prerequisites
- In operations we cross-check the same window in SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or the Azure SQL portal with `sys.dm_*` views so live metrics match what Splunk shows.
- Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices`, Azure Monitor metrics.
- Ensure the following data sources are available: `NormalizedRUConsumption`, `Total Request Units`.
- For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

### Step 1 — Configure data collection
Map exact metric names from your Azure diagnostic settings. Alert when normalized consumption >90% sustained. Split by partition key if available in custom dimensions.

### Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=azure sourcetype="mssql:azuremonitor" OR sourcetype="azure:metrics"
| search metric_name="NormalizedRUConsumption" OR "*Cosmos*"
| timechart span=5m avg(average) as norm_ru by DatabaseName, CollectionName
| where norm_ru > 0.9
```

#### Understanding this SPL

**Azure Cosmos DB RU Consumption** — Normalized RU/s consumption vs provisioned throughput identifies hot partitions and autoscale effectiveness.

Documented **Data sources**: `NormalizedRUConsumption`, `Total Request Units`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices`, Azure Monitor metrics. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: azure; **sourcetype**: mssql:azuremonitor, azure:metrics. If that sourcetype is not mentioned in Data sources, double-check parsing or update the documentation to match the feed you actually ingest.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

- Scopes the data: index=azure, sourcetype="mssql:azuremonitor". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
- Applies an explicit `search` filter to narrow the current result set.
- `timechart` plots the metric over time using **span=5m** buckets with a separate series **by DatabaseName, CollectionName** — ideal for trending and alerting on this use case.
- Filters the current rows with `where norm_ru > 0.9` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.


### Step 3 — Validate
For the same time range, compare Splunk results with the engine’s own tools and system views (SQL Server: SQL Server Management Studio and `sys.dm_*`; Oracle: Oracle Enterprise Manager, SQLcl, or `V$` views; MySQL: Workbench or `performance_schema` / `SHOW` output; PostgreSQL: `pg_stat_*` in psql or pgAdmin; MongoDB: mongosh or Atlas metrics; Cassandra: nodetool; Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Kibana or REST `_cat` / `_cluster/health`; ClickHouse: `system` tables in clickhouse-client; Snowflake: Snowsight or `ACCOUNT_USAGE`; others: the managed PaaS console). Confirm event counts, field names, timestamps, and Splunk role permissions.

### Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (RU consumption %), Table (collections over threshold), Single value (hottest collection).

## SPL

```spl
index=azure sourcetype="mssql:azuremonitor" OR sourcetype="azure:metrics"
| search metric_name="NormalizedRUConsumption" OR "*Cosmos*"
| timechart span=5m avg(average) as norm_ru by DatabaseName, CollectionName
| where norm_ru > 0.9
```

## Visualization

Line chart (RU consumption %), Table (collections over threshold), Single value (hottest collection).

## Known False Positives

Autoscale events, service tier changes, and Microsoft-side maintenance in Azure can move CPU and storage metrics; compare with the Azure service health and your deployment pipeline.

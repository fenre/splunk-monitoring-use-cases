# UC-3.2.27 · Ingress Controller Error Rates

## Description

Controller-level 5xx and upstream errors isolate bad ingress classes, TLS backends, and canary routes before user-facing SLO breach.

## Value

Controller-level 5xx and upstream errors isolate bad ingress classes, TLS backends, and canary routes before user-facing SLO breach.

## Implementation

Standardize access log JSON with `ingress_class`, `upstream`, `status`. Baseline per ingress. Alert on error rate versus 7-day same-hour baseline.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: Ingress controller log pipeline (NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy).
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=kube:ingress:nginx`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Standardize access log JSON with `ingress_class`, `upstream`, `status`. Baseline per ingress. Alert on error rate versus 7-day same-hour baseline.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=k8s sourcetype="kube:ingress:nginx"
| eval err=if(status>=500,1,0)
| bin _time span=5m
| stats sum(err) as e, count as n by ingress_class, upstream, _time
| eval err_rate=if(n>0, round(100*e/n,2), 0)
| where err_rate>2
| sort -err_rate
```

Understanding this SPL

**Ingress Controller Error Rates** — Controller-level 5xx and upstream errors isolate bad ingress classes, TLS backends, and canary routes before user-facing SLO breach.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=kube:ingress:nginx`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): Ingress controller log pipeline (NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy). The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: k8s; **sourcetype**: kube:ingress:nginx. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=k8s, sourcetype="kube:ingress:nginx". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **err** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Discretizes time or numeric ranges with `bin`/`bucket`.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by ingress_class, upstream, _time** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• `eval` defines or adjusts **err_rate** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Filters the current rows with `where err_rate>2` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (5xx rate by class), Table (upstream, err %), Single value (global ingress 5xx/min).

## SPL

```spl
index=k8s sourcetype="kube:ingress:nginx"
| eval err=if(status>=500,1,0)
| bin _time span=5m
| stats sum(err) as e, count as n by ingress_class, upstream, _time
| eval err_rate=if(n>0, round(100*e/n,2), 0)
| where err_rate>2
| sort -err_rate
```

# UC-6.2.10 · Storage Class Transition Tracking

## Description

Validates that objects move to IA/Glacier/Archive per policy. Stalled transitions indicate rule gaps or unsupported objects.

## Value

Validates that objects move to IA/Glacier/Archive per policy. Stalled transitions indicate rule gaps or unsupported objects.

## Implementation

Ingest periodic inventory or CloudWatch breakdown. Compare STANDARD % vs policy targets. Report buckets with excessive STANDARD after expected transition age.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: S3 Inventory, Azure Blob inventory, CloudWatch storage class metrics.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: S3 Inventory reports (CSV), `BucketSizeBytes` by `StorageType`.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Ingest periodic inventory or CloudWatch breakdown. Compare STANDARD % vs policy targets. Report buckets with excessive STANDARD after expected transition age.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=aws sourcetype="aws:s3:inventory" OR sourcetype="aws:cloudwatch" metric_name="BucketSizeBytes"
| stats sum(size_bytes) as bytes by bucket_name, storage_class
| eventstats sum(bytes) as total by bucket_name
| eval pct=round(bytes/total*100,1)
| where storage_class="STANDARD" AND pct > 40
```

Understanding this SPL

**Storage Class Transition Tracking** — Validates that objects move to IA/Glacier/Archive per policy. Stalled transitions indicate rule gaps or unsupported objects.

Documented **Data sources**: S3 Inventory reports (CSV), `BucketSizeBytes` by `StorageType`. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): S3 Inventory, Azure Blob inventory, CloudWatch storage class metrics. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: aws; **sourcetype**: aws:s3:inventory, aws:cloudwatch. If that sourcetype is not mentioned in Data sources, double-check parsing or update the documentation to match the feed you actually ingest.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=aws, sourcetype="aws:s3:inventory". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by bucket_name, storage_class** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• `eventstats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by bucket_name** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• `eval` defines or adjusts **pct** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Filters the current rows with `where storage_class="STANDARD" AND pct > 40` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Stacked bar (storage class % per bucket), Table (buckets with high STANDARD %), Line chart (class mix over time).

## SPL

```spl
index=aws sourcetype="aws:s3:inventory" OR sourcetype="aws:cloudwatch" metric_name="BucketSizeBytes"
| stats sum(size_bytes) as bytes by bucket_name, storage_class
| eventstats sum(bytes) as total by bucket_name
| eval pct=round(bytes/total*100,1)
| where storage_class="STANDARD" AND pct > 40
```

## Visualization

Stacked bar (storage class % per bucket), Table (buckets with high STANDARD %), Line chart (class mix over time).

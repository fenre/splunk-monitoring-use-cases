# UC-6.2.8 · Bucket Policy Change Audit

## Description

Unexpected bucket policy or IAM policy changes can expose data. Audit trail supports SOC2/PCI evidence and fast rollback.

## Value

Unexpected bucket policy or IAM policy changes can expose data. Audit trail supports SOC2/PCI evidence and fast rollback.

## Implementation

Ingest CloudTrail S3 and IAM policy events. Enrich with CMDB owner. Alert on changes outside change windows or from non-break-glass principals.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_aws` (CloudTrail), Azure Activity Log.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `PutBucketPolicy`, `DeleteBucketPolicy`, `SetContainerAcl` (Azure equivalents).
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Ingest CloudTrail S3 and IAM policy events. Enrich with CMDB owner. Alert on changes outside change windows or from non-break-glass principals.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=aws sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventName IN ("PutBucketPolicy","DeleteBucketPolicy","PutBucketAcl")
| table _time, requestParameters.bucketName, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, eventName
| sort -_time
```

Understanding this SPL

**Bucket Policy Change Audit** — Unexpected bucket policy or IAM policy changes can expose data. Audit trail supports SOC2/PCI evidence and fast rollback.

Documented **Data sources**: `PutBucketPolicy`, `DeleteBucketPolicy`, `SetContainerAcl` (Azure equivalents). **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_aws` (CloudTrail), Azure Activity Log. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: aws; **sourcetype**: aws:cloudtrail. If that sourcetype is not mentioned in Data sources, double-check parsing or update the documentation to match the feed you actually ingest.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=aws, sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• Pipeline stage (see **Bucket Policy Change Audit**): table _time, requestParameters.bucketName, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, eventName
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.


Step 3 — Validate
Compare the same metric, object name, and interval in the vendor or cloud console (array, backup, or object store) that is the source of truth for this feed.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Include who owns the cloud account and the bucket lifecycle policy, because object alerts often need a finance or app owner, not only the storage team. Consider visualizations: Timeline (policy changes), Table (bucket, user, action), Single value (changes last 24h).

## SPL

```spl
index=aws sourcetype="aws:cloudtrail" eventName IN ("PutBucketPolicy","DeleteBucketPolicy","PutBucketAcl")
| table _time, requestParameters.bucketName, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, eventName
| sort -_time
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count as events
  from datamodel=Web.Web
  by Web.http_method Web.dest span=5m
| sort -events
```

## Visualization

Timeline (policy changes), Table (bucket, user, action), Single value (changes last 24h).

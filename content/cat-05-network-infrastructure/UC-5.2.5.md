# UC-5.2.5 · High-Risk Port Exposure

## Description

Allowed traffic to RDP/SMB/Telnet from untrusted zones indicates policy gaps.

## Value

Allowed traffic to RDP/SMB/Telnet from untrusted zones indicates policy gaps.

## Implementation

Monitor allow rules for external traffic to high-risk ports. Alert on any matches. Review and tighten rules.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_paloalto`, `TA-fortinet_fortigate`, Cisco Secure Firewall Add-on, `Splunk_TA_juniper` (SRX).
• Ensure the following data sources are available: Firewall traffic logs.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Monitor allow rules for external traffic to high-risk ports. Alert on any matches. Review and tighten rules.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=firewall action="allowed" (dest_port=3389 OR dest_port=445 OR dest_port=23)
| where NOT cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src)
| stats count by src, dest, dest_port | sort -count
```

Understanding this SPL

**High-Risk Port Exposure** — Allowed traffic to RDP/SMB/Telnet from untrusted zones indicates policy gaps.

Documented **Data sources**: Firewall traffic logs. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_paloalto`, `TA-fortinet_fortigate`, Cisco Secure Firewall Add-on, `Splunk_TA_juniper` (SRX). The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: firewall.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=firewall. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• Filters the current rows with `where NOT cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src)` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by src, dest, dest_port** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions (useful for per-host, per-user, or per-entity comparisons for this use case).
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count sum(All_Traffic.bytes_in) as bytes_in sum(All_Traffic.bytes_out) as bytes_out
  from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
  by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest All_Traffic.action span=1h
| eval bytes=bytes_in+bytes_out
| sort -bytes
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**High-Risk Port Exposure** — Allowed traffic to RDP/SMB/Telnet from untrusted zones indicates policy gaps.

Documented **Data sources**: Firewall traffic logs. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_paloalto`, `TA-fortinet_fortigate`, Cisco Secure Firewall Add-on, `Splunk_TA_juniper` (SRX). The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

This **CIM or accelerated** block uses normalized field names and/or `tstats` over data models. Enable **acceleration** on the referenced models (and correct CIM knowledge objects) or the search may return nothing.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` against accelerated summaries for data model `Network_Traffic.All_Traffic` — enable acceleration for that model.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **bytes** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Table (source, dest, port), Bar chart by port, Map.

## SPL

```spl
index=firewall action="allowed" (dest_port=3389 OR dest_port=445 OR dest_port=23)
| where NOT cidrmatch("10.0.0.0/8", src)
| stats count by src, dest, dest_port | sort -count
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` count sum(All_Traffic.bytes_in) as bytes_in sum(All_Traffic.bytes_out) as bytes_out
  from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
  by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest All_Traffic.action span=1h
| eval bytes=bytes_in+bytes_out
| sort -bytes
```

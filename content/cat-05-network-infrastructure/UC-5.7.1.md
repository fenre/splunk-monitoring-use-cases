# UC-5.7.1 · Top Talkers Analysis

## Description

Identifies top bandwidth consumers. Essential for troubleshooting congestion and capacity planning.

## Value

Identifies top bandwidth consumers. Essential for troubleshooting congestion and capacity planning.

## Implementation

Export NetFlow from routers/switches to a NetFlow collector that forwards to Splunk. Install NetFlow TA for field parsing.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: Splunk Add-on for NetFlow.
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=netflow`, sFlow, IPFIX.
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Export NetFlow from routers/switches to a NetFlow collector that forwards to Splunk. Install NetFlow TA for field parsing.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=netflow
| stats sum(bytes) as total_bytes by src, dest
| sort -total_bytes | head 20
| eval total_GB=round(total_bytes/1073741824,2)
```

Understanding this SPL

**Top Talkers Analysis** — Identifies top bandwidth consumers. Essential for troubleshooting congestion and capacity planning.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=netflow`, sFlow, IPFIX. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): Splunk Add-on for NetFlow. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: netflow.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=netflow. Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `stats` rolls up events into metrics; results are split **by src, dest** so each row reflects one combination of those dimensions.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.
• Limits the number of rows with `head`.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **total_GB** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` sum(All_Traffic.bytes_in) as bytes_in sum(All_Traffic.bytes_out) as bytes_out
  from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
  by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest span=1h
| eval bytes=bytes_in+bytes_out
| sort -bytes
| head 20
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**Top Talkers Analysis** — Identifies top bandwidth consumers. Essential for troubleshooting congestion and capacity planning.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=netflow`, sFlow, IPFIX. **App/TA** (typical add-on context): Splunk Add-on for NetFlow. The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

This **CIM or accelerated** block uses normalized field names and/or `tstats` over data models. Enable **acceleration** on the referenced models (and correct CIM knowledge objects) or the search may return nothing.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` against accelerated summaries for data model `Network_Traffic.All_Traffic` — enable acceleration for that model.
• `eval` defines or adjusts **bytes** — often to normalize units, derive a ratio, or prepare for thresholds.
• Orders rows with `sort` — combine with `head`/`tail` for top-N patterns.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and metric indexes for `mstats`) for the models or datasets referenced above; otherwise `tstats`/`mstats` may return no results from summaries.


Step 3 — Validate
For the same time range, compare Splunk event counts to your NetFlow or IPFIX exporter, Splunk Stream, or flow collector. Spot-check a few `src`/`dest` pairs and byte totals against the device or cloud flow UI. Confirm your index and `sourcetype` (for example `stream:netflow`, `stream:ipfix`, or `splunk_stream`) match how you ingest.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Table (source, dest, bytes), Sankey diagram, Bar chart.

## SPL

```spl
index=netflow
| stats sum(bytes) as total_bytes by src, dest
| sort -total_bytes | head 20
| eval total_GB=round(total_bytes/1073741824,2)
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` sum(All_Traffic.bytes_in) as bytes_in sum(All_Traffic.bytes_out) as bytes_out
  from datamodel=Network_Traffic.All_Traffic
  by All_Traffic.src All_Traffic.dest span=1h
| eval bytes=bytes_in+bytes_out
| sort -bytes
| head 20
```

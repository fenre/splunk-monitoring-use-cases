*Remote access gateway tunnel drops break hybrid connectivity between Azure and on-premises networks.*

---

## Description

VPN gateway tunnel drops break hybrid connectivity between Azure and on-premises networks. Nearly every enterprise Azure customer relies on site-to-site VPN; tunnel status is a fundamental availability signal.

## Value

VPN gateway tunnel drops break hybrid connectivity between Azure and on-premises networks. Nearly every enterprise Azure customer relies on site-to-site VPN; tunnel status is a fundamental availability signal.

## Implementation

Collect Azure Monitor metrics for VPN Gateway resources. Monitor `TunnelAverageBandwidth` (drops to zero when tunnel is down), `TunnelEgressBytes`, `TunnelIngressBytes`, and `BGPPeerStatus`. Alert when tunnel bandwidth drops to zero or BGP peer status changes. Correlate with Azure Service Health events for planned maintenance.

## Detailed Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices` (Azure Monitor metrics).
- Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=azure:monitor:metric` (Microsoft.Network/vpnGateways).
- For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

### Step 1 — Configure data collection
Collect Azure Monitor metrics for VPN Gateway resources. Monitor `TunnelAverageBandwidth` (drops to zero when tunnel is down), `TunnelEgressBytes`, `TunnelIngressBytes`, and `BGPPeerStatus`. Alert when tunnel bandwidth drops to zero or BGP peer status changes. Correlate with Azure Service Health events for planned maintenance.

### Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=cloud sourcetype="azure:monitor:metric" resource_type="microsoft.network/vpngateways" metric_name="TunnelAverageBandwidth" OR metric_name="TunnelEgressBytes"
| timechart span=5m avg(average) as avg_bandwidth by resource_name
| where avg_bandwidth < 1
```

#### Understanding this SPL

**Azure VPN Gateway Tunnel Status** — VPN gateway tunnel drops break hybrid connectivity between Azure and on-premises networks. Nearly every enterprise Azure customer relies on site-to-site VPN; tunnel status is a fundamental availability signal.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=azure:monitor:metric` (Microsoft.Network/vpnGateways). **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices` (Azure Monitor metrics). The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: cloud; **sourcetype**: azure:monitor:metric. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

- Scopes the data: index=cloud, sourcetype="azure:monitor:metric". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
- `timechart` plots the metric over time using **span=5m** buckets with a separate series **by resource_name** — ideal for trending and alerting on this use case.
- Filters the current rows with `where avg_bandwidth < 1` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.

Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.storage_free_percent) as free_pct
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Storage
  by Performance.host span=1h
| sort 10 free_pct
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**Azure VPN Gateway Tunnel Status** — VPN gateway tunnel drops break hybrid connectivity between Azure and on-premises networks.

If you map cloud vendor fields into the CIM, this variant uses normalized names and `tstats` on accelerated models. The raw vendor search in Step 2 is still the first stop for troubleshooting.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

- Uses `tstats` on the `Performance` data model (Storage node)—enable that model in Data Models and the CIM add-on, or the search may return no rows.

- Uses `sort` to rank results; add `head` to limit the table.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and the right field aliases) for the models or datasets above; otherwise `tstats` may not find summaries.


### Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

### Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Line chart (tunnel bandwidth over time), Single value (tunnel status up/down), Table (tunnels with status).

## SPL

```spl
index=cloud sourcetype="azure:monitor:metric" resource_type="microsoft.network/vpngateways" metric_name="TunnelAverageBandwidth" OR metric_name="TunnelEgressBytes"
| timechart span=5m avg(average) as avg_bandwidth by resource_name
| where avg_bandwidth < 1
```

## CIM SPL

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.storage_free_percent) as free_pct
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.Storage
  by Performance.host span=1h
| sort 10 free_pct
```

## Visualization

Line chart (tunnel bandwidth over time), Single value (tunnel status up/down), Table (tunnels with status).

## Known False Positives

Short spikes at deploy time, autoscale thrash, or a noisy neighbor on shared hosts can look bad for a few minutes. We require the condition to last across several intervals or clear on its own before we wake someone.

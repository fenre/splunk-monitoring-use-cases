# UC-4.2.53 · Azure Traffic Manager Endpoint Health

## Description

Traffic Manager provides DNS-based global load balancing. Degraded endpoints cause traffic to shift, but undetected health changes can leave users routed to unhealthy regions.

## Value

Traffic Manager provides DNS-based global load balancing. Degraded endpoints cause traffic to shift, but undetected health changes can leave users routed to unhealthy regions.

## Implementation

Collect Azure Monitor metrics for Traffic Manager profiles. Monitor `ProbeAgentCurrentEndpointStateByProfileResourceId` for endpoint health percentage and `QpsByEndpoint` for query distribution. Alert when any endpoint degrades or goes offline. Track DNS query patterns to verify failover behavior is correct after endpoint changes.

## Detailed Implementation

Prerequisites
• Install and configure the required add-on or app: `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices` (Azure Monitor metrics).
• Ensure the following data sources are available: `sourcetype=azure:monitor:metric` (Microsoft.Network/trafficManagerProfiles).
• For app installation, inputs.conf, and Splunk directory layout, see the Implementation guide: docs/implementation-guide.md

Step 1 — Configure data collection
Collect Azure Monitor metrics for Traffic Manager profiles. Monitor `ProbeAgentCurrentEndpointStateByProfileResourceId` for endpoint health percentage and `QpsByEndpoint` for query distribution. Alert when any endpoint degrades or goes offline. Track DNS query patterns to verify failover behavior is correct after endpoint changes.

Step 2 — Create the search and alert
Run the following SPL in Search (then save as report or alert; adjust time range and threshold as needed):

```spl
index=cloud sourcetype="azure:monitor:metric" resource_type="microsoft.network/trafficmanagerprofiles" metric_name="ProbeAgentCurrentEndpointStateByProfileResourceId"
| timechart span=5m latest(average) as health_pct by resource_name
| where health_pct < 100
```

Understanding this SPL

**Azure Traffic Manager Endpoint Health** — Traffic Manager provides DNS-based global load balancing. Degraded endpoints cause traffic to shift, but undetected health changes can leave users routed to unhealthy regions.

Documented **Data sources**: `sourcetype=azure:monitor:metric` (Microsoft.Network/trafficManagerProfiles). **App/TA** (typical add-on context): `Splunk_TA_microsoft-cloudservices` (Azure Monitor metrics). The SPL below should target the same indexes and sourcetypes you configured for that feed—rename `index=` / `sourcetype=` if your deployment differs.

The first pipeline stage scopes events using **index**: cloud; **sourcetype**: azure:monitor:metric. That sourcetype matches what this use case lists under Data sources.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Scopes the data: index=cloud, sourcetype="azure:monitor:metric". Cross-check against **Data sources** above so indexes and sourcetypes match your ingestion.
• `timechart` plots the metric over time using **span=5m** buckets with a separate series **by resource_name** — ideal for trending and alerting on this use case.
• Filters the current rows with `where health_pct < 100` — typically the threshold or rule expression for this monitoring goal.


Optional CIM / accelerated variant (same use case, normalized fields via Common Information Model):

```spl
| tstats `summariesonly` avg(Performance.cpu_load_percent) as agg_value
  from datamodel=Performance where nodename=Performance.CPU
  by Performance.host span=5m
| sort - agg_value
```

Understanding this CIM / accelerated SPL

**Azure Traffic Manager Endpoint Health** — Traffic Manager provides DNS-based global load balancing.

If you map cloud vendor fields into the CIM, this variant uses normalized names and `tstats` on accelerated models. The raw vendor search in Step 2 is still the first stop for troubleshooting.

**Pipeline walkthrough**

• Uses `tstats` on accelerated data model the CPU-related Performance model — enable that model in Data Models and CIM add-ons, or the search may return no rows.

• Uses `sort` to rank results; add `head` to limit the table.

Enable Data Model Acceleration (and the right field aliases) for the models or datasets above; otherwise `tstats` may not find summaries.

Step 3 — Validate
Confirm that events are present in the index and that the search returns expected results. Compare with known good/bad scenarios if applicable. Verify field extractions and index permissions.

Step 4 — Operationalize
Add the search to a dashboard or set up alert actions (email, webhook, PagerDuty, etc.) as required. Document the use case in your runbook and assign an owner. Consider visualizations: Status grid (endpoint × health), Line chart (health % per endpoint), Single value (degraded endpoint count).
